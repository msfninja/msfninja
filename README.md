### Hi there :wave:

I like complicated stuff and [mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js).

My favourite domains are web development&#8212;especially back-end web
development&#8212;as well as cybersecurity and cryptography. I mostly
work with JavaScript and Node.js, but some projects deviate from
those languages.

If you'd like to collaborate on one of my projects, or want me to
collaborate on one of your projects, I'd be more than happy to do
that. Query me on irc.libera.chat (`/query msfninja`) or [send an
e-mail](mailto:msfninja@pm.me).
